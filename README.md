# 2048-game

Deployment: https://Kirill-Cherepanov.github.io/2048-game/src/

It's been a while since I built this project. The code needs a complete rewrite preferably in Typescript. I'm satisfied with not using any frameworks for it, as it makes the bundle extremely lightweight.

P.S. /dist is not ignored because I use github pages for hosting and don't want to bother with github actions to make it work.
